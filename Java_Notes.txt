Welcome to Java
Last commit in master branch fails and so that i am adding a line here to raise a conflict in during merging.

1. Boolean check Eg . boolean sample = 77 < 40 
2. scanner class Eg.  Scanner  reference(-->anyVariable)  =  (--> Object of scanner )-->   new Scanner();
3. In loops we can use like Eg.  arrayname.length ---> no need to use like length(); 
4. Hash set is a hash table without duplicate values.

Now this line is added to check merging branches in git.

Now this is line of master branch which i used to check whether any conflicts get arise during merging of two branches.

Merge completed successfully...!

Now second branch is about to be created i.e the branch is nested within patch 1 branch.

Third branch created from second branch and we are gonna merge this. We are about to check which branch is getting updated after merge.
