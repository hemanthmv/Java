Welcome to Java


1. Boolean check Eg . boolean sample = 77 < 40 
2. scanner class Eg.  Scanner  reference(-->anyVariable)  =  (--> Object of scanner )-->   new Scanner();
3. In loops we can use like Eg.  arrayname.length ---> no need to use like length(); 
4. Hash set is a hash table without duplicate values


Now this is line of master branch which i used to check whether any conflicts get arise during merging of two branches.
