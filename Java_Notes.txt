Welcome to Java

Last commit in master branch fails and so that i am adding a line here to raise a conflict in during merging.

1. Boolean check Eg . boolean sample = 77 < 40 
2. scanner class Eg.  Scanner  reference(-->anyVariable)  =  (--> Object of scanner )-->   new Scanner();
3. In loops we can use like Eg.  arrayname.length ---> no need to use like length(); 
4. Hash set is a hash table without duplicate values.

Now this line is added to check merging branches in git.
